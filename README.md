# Form Handling in React

This project demonstrates form handling in React using both controlled components and the Formik library. It provides a practical example of managing user input and form validation in a user registration form.

## Features

1. **Controlled Components**:
   - Fields for username, email, and password.
   - Manual state management using `useState`.
   - Custom validation for empty fields.

2. **Formik with Yup**:
   - Simplified form state management using Formik's `Form` and `Field` components.
   - Validation schema powered by Yup for advanced validation.
